A simple terminal interaction for creating spotify playlists based on user's mood


<strong> IMPORTANT </strong>

Spotipy has not released support for Spotify's new API reference, meaning users are not allowed to make unauthorized calls to 
their spotify account (and thus unable to create playlists). Hopefully this is implemented by spotipy soon, would love to see this in action!
